## Report for October 16

### Challenges

- The main challenges were first, learning and getting familiar with the languages (javascript, typescript, html, css, sass),  frameworks (angular, ionic, express.js), and other tools (docker, mariadb, sequelize) used in this project, and second, organizing ourselves and planning what should be done when and by whom and in what manner. And also how we want to solve the tasks and milestones given to us.

### Risks

- The risk is that our planning doesn't work out.

### Learning Outcomes

- To help with the organization, we created a [wiki](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2019-team10/wiki) and a [project](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2019-team10/projects) on our github page. We also use Slack and Whatsapp for communication and coordination.
- All of us allready had some knowledge of some of the technologies involved in this project but all of has had to learn new things, mostly the basics of the technologies noted above, but to give some examples, how to create routes for navigation or how to validate a form.
